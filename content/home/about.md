About Me: 
{style="font-size: 1.2rem; background: #00D8FF ; -webkit-background-clip: text; -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;"}

I am a PhD candidate and graduate researcher at the University of Southern California / Carnegie Observatories. My research is on theoretical modeling and simulations of tidal interactions between exoplanets and exomoons and how this affects orbital evolution, habitability, and detectability. I am especially interested in the search for the first exomoon, habitable worlds outside of the solar system, and the next frontier of missions that will answer some of astronomy's biggest questions. 

In addition to my excitement for outer space, I enjoy having family barbecues, playing ice hockey, and hunting/fishing in the great outdoors.
