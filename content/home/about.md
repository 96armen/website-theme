About Me: 
{style="font-size: 1.2rem; background: #8DECFC ; -webkit-background-clip: text; -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;"}
I am a PhD candidate and graduate researcher at the University of Southern California / Carnegie Observatories. My research focuses on theoretical modeling and simulations of tidal interactions between exoplanets and exomoons including the impact on orbital evolution, habitability, and detectability. I am interested in the search for life outside our solar system, where this question of habitability can be answered through continued analysis of exoplanet properties and advancement of scientific instruments and telescopes.
