About Me: 
{style="font-size: 1.2rem; background: #8DECFC ; -webkit-background-clip: text; -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;"}
I am a PhD candidate and graduate researcher at the University of Southern California / Carnegie Observatories. My research focuses on theoretical modeling and simulations of tidal interactions between exoplanets and exomoons and how this affects orbital evolution, habitability, and detectability. I am especially interested in the search for the first exomoon, habitable worlds outside of the solar system, and the next frontier of missions that will answer some of astronomy's biggest questions.
